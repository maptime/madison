#Making Easy Google Maps with Custom Data from Your Mobile Device

Most of us are familiar with Google Maps for directions, and may have used Google Drive for documents, but did you know they could be used together to create an individualized map with your data?

This next Maptime [@RashaunaMead](https://twitter.com/rashaunamead) will focus on the Google product called [My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/splash?hl=en_US&app=mp). My Maps is simple to use and has basic functions that make it easy for new users to quickly begin mapping. We will go over adding data, basic styling, and sharing your map. We will learn ways to leverage Google Sheets to collaboratively add data, and will also cover how to collect locational data from our phones by using [IFFT](https://ifttt.com/).

New to mapping? No worries! My Maps is simple to use and no previous mapping experience is necessary. Bring a friend!

If you don't already have a Google account, you may want to sign up for one before the class, if you would like some hands on experience during Maptime. If you have a laptop, please feel free to bring it. We will also have about 10 laptops available for people to use.

###Pizza    

There will also be free pizza provided by [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/). Please be sure to RSVP so we can be sure to bring enough pizza.
