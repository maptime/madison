**Event Recap: OpenStreetMap (OSM) Data Editing**
For the February 2017 edition of Maptime Madison, we learned about OpenStreetMap (OSM) from Spencer Gardner, a transportation planner here in Madison. Thank you, Spencer, for teaching us all about OSM!

If you missed out on joining us at the [Bubbler](http://madisonbubbler.org/) last month or want to look back at what we learned, you can check out Spencer's slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nv38kAuAeCEC2NuqA2ol5-T5GkeLnkdoiDYyPx5VwvQ/edit?usp=sharing).
