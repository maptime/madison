This month at Maptime Madison, [Kristen Vincent](http://kristenvincent.github.io/) will show us how to make an interactive thematic map with [Carto](https://carto.com/), formerly CartoDB! But first, what in the world is a thematic map? Thematic maps use number based data to show the distribution or pattern of a particular geography. We’ll review a few thematic map types (examples [here](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/07/us/drug-overdose-deaths-in-the-us.html?smid=pl-share&_r=1), [here](https://carto.com/gallery/), and [here](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/08/us/census-race-map.html)), discuss best practices, and talk data before turning to [Carto Builder](https://carto.com/builder/)—a web-based mapping and spatial analysis tool—to make interactive choropleth maps of US population data. With these new tools under your belt, you’ll be able to explore and display any spatial dataset thematically!
