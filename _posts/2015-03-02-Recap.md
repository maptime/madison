###Event Recap
We hosted our first meeting in 2015 on CartoDB, an online data vizualization and mapping software.

![picture of Katie talking](img/cartodb.jpg)  
[@Katie](https://twitter.com/katiekowalsky) talked about the basics of mapping through [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/) and how to get around the website and the different ways you can use this service for manipulating data and visualizing it.

If you missed out on joining us at the [Bubbler](http://madisonbubbler.org/) for learning about CartoDB, you can view the slides and outline [here](https://github.com/MaptimeMadison/CartoDB) on our GitHub. We also have a fabulous tutorial, created by [@Chris](https://twitter.com/chrislhenrick) available [here](https://github.com/MaptimeMadison/cartodb-tutorial) that goes more in depth about CartoDB's advanced SQL features.

###Next Maptime!
