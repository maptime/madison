This month at [Maptime Madison](http://maptime.io/madison/), [Eric Nost](https://twitter.com/ericnost?lang=en) will take us one step further in the world of web mapping! Tools like CARTO make it relatively simple to produce interactive web maps, but sometimes you want to have greater control of the design, especially when your map is part of a page or website. For that, it's often handy to turn to programming. We'll walkthrough the basics of programming, what programming means in web mapping, and how to get started. In our tutorial we'll use [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)—a Javascript library for dynamically generating SVG graphics—to make a [map](http://ericnost.github.io/election2016/) of the 2016 presidential election.

**Supplies**

Please bring a laptop if you have one, otherwise, there will be computers available for your use.

If you want to get started early, you can download the files that we'll work with [here](https://github.com/ericnost/ericnost.github.io)!

If you plan on using a Windows system, you'll need to download and install [Prepros](https://prepros.io/) in order to render your map (Mac is way easier!). For either Windows or Mac, you'll also need a text editor to view and change the code. You can use the defaults on either system, but you might find it much easier to use a text editor specifically designed for programming, such as [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).

If you don’t have time to download these before Maptime, don’t worry! We’ll walk through the downloads right away.

<!-- **Pizza!!!**

There will be free pizza donated by [Carto](https://carto.com/)! Please RSVP so we know how much pizza to get! -->
