**Event Recap: Carto**
For the December 2016 edition of Maptime Madison we learned about thematic maps and Carto from [Kristen Vincent](http://kristenvincent.github.io), a Maptime Madison co-organizer.  It was a great time learning about web mapping with Carto!

Thanks again to [Carto](http://www.twitter.com/carto) for the free pizza!
