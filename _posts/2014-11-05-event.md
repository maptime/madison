title: Hand-Drawn Maps!

These days with most maps being made on the computer, Maptime Madison is going against the grain by kicking off with a session on hand-drawn maps. We'll learn from [@DylanMoriarty](https://twitter.com/DylanMoriarty), a cartographer and illustrator (aka the "Bob Ross" of hand-drawn maps). We'll go over the basic principles of cartography and put them to practice by making our own maps. 

Maptime is inclusive - everyone is welcome and encouraged to join in on the fun!
