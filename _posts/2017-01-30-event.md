This month at Maptime Madison, [Clare Trainor](http://www.claretrainor.com/) will discuss the importance of storytelling and show you how to create and use [Esri Story Maps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/en/). What are Story Maps? They are web applications that let authors combine beautiful maps with narrative text, striking images, and multimedia, including video. The applications are designed to be attractive and usable by anyone. We will walk through a variety of examples and show you how to use Esri Story Maps to help transform your data and idea into a powerful story.
