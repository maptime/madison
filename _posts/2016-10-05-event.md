It's time for a new season on Maptime Madison!

To kick things off, we'll have a "show and tell" as cartographer [Caroline Rose](https://twitter.com/cmrrose) will talk about sculptural or three-dimensional maps, including lessons learned in creating them and examples from many different cartographers. Caroline has been creating and admiring sculptural maps for many years, and she helped curate a tangible maps exhibit in Minneapolis in October of 2015. The presentation will take place in the Chart Room North, Memorial Union on the UW-Madison campus, where her 3D, magnetic map of Lake Mendota is installed.

Feel free to bring your own examples of sculptural maps to share after the presentation!

**Pizza!!!**

Unfortunately, no outside food can be brought into the meeting space, so after the presentation, we will move outside to the Terrace to enjoy free pizza provided by [Carto](https://carto.com/). Please RSVP so we know how much pizza to get.

**When and Where**

Wednesday, October 5th, 6pm - 8pm @ Chart Room North, UW-Madison Memorial Union, 800 Langdon Street, Madison, WI 53706
