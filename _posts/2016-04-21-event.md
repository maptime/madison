This month at Maptime!, we'll be focusing on a brand new tool that will allow you to better design maps for the web. Learn all about the newest generation of basemap design software: Mapbox Studio! [Brad Leege](twitter.com/BradLeege), Madison Maptime-r and Mapboxer will walk us through the new changes to the design tool and how we can build basemaps that are incredible! 

Imagine being able to design a map from outerspace, inspired by art, or perfect for hiking outdoors... Mapbox Studio allows you to create basemaps that are as diverse as they are high-tech.
