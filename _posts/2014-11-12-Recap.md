###Event Recap
We had such a blast at our first Maptime Madison event! Thanks to all the people that joined in on the fun.

We were so impressed with the turnout, we had almost 30 people from all walks of life, including students at UW-Madison, cartography and GIS professionals, and even some kids!

Here's some of our new Maptimers showing off their work at the end of the night. Check out our Twitter [@Maptime Madison](https://twitter.com/MaptimeMadison) for more images of the incredible maps our new friends made. Keep up the great work!

[@DylanMoriarty](https://twitter.com/DylanMoriarty) led our event on hand drawn mapping and we learned a ton from his beautiful slides and live tutorial. He put his slides online [available here](https://speakerdeck.com/dylanmoriarty/maps-by-hand) for those who are curious about the maps he used or want to teach others! Feel free to share. 

###Next Maptime!
We'll be announcing shortly about our next meeting in December. Check your inboxes or our Twitter [@Maptime Madison](https://twitter.com/MaptimeMadison) for the announcement!
