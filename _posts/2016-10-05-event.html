<p>It&#39;s time for a new season on Maptime Madison!</p>
<p>To kick things off, we&#39;ll have a &quot;show and tell&quot; as cartographer <a href="https://twitter.com/cmrrose">Caroline Rose</a> will talk about sculptural or three-dimensional maps, including lessons learned in creating them and examples from many different cartographers. Caroline has been creating and admiring sculptural maps for many years, and she helped curate a tangible maps exhibit in Minneapolis in October of 2015. The presentation will take place in the Chart Room North, Memorial Union on the UW-Madison campus, where her 3D, magnetic map of Lake Mendota is installed.</p>
