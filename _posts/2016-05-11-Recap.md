**Event Recap: Mapbox Studio**
For the April 2016 edition of Maptime Madison we learned all about the latest version of Mapbox Studio from [Brad Leege](https://twitter.com/bradleege), a Maptime regular and Mapboxer.  It was a great time learning how to use the latest version of this design software to make awesome basemaps!

Thanks again to [CartoDB](http://www.twitter.com/cartodb) for the free pizza!

If you missed out on joining us at the [Bubbler](http://madisonbubbler.org/) for Mapbox Studio, you can view Brad's slides [here](http://slides.com/bleege/deck-1/).
