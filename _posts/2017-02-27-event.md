This month at Maptime Madison, Spencer Gardner, a Maptime regular and transportation planner here in Madison, will teach us about [OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://twitter.com/openstreetmap?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). We will have a general overview of OSM, its origins and growth as a data platform, and current applications. We will also discuss the data model and learn about platforms for editing OSM data in our own neighborhoods. Finally, we will leave some time for people to try their hand at edits!
